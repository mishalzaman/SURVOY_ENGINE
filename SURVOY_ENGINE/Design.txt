Scene Objects

The scene would need to store all the objects that will be rendered on the next render pass.

Class: Object (position, scale, material)
inherited: 
	ObjectText (text),
	ObjectStatic

Grouping shader and texture

Group by Value within each Key Group: Within each key group, further group the objects based on their value.
Given your data {x: a, x: b, x: a, x: c, y: a}, the process will look like this:

First Grouping:

Group 1: {x: a, x: b, x: a, x: c}
Group 2: {y: a}
Second Grouping (within each Key Group):

For x:
{x: a, x: a}
{x: b}
{x: c}
For y:
{y: a}
